# Scikit-learn Exploration Project

This repository serves as a personal exploration and collection of examples utilizing the powerful scikit-learn machine learning library in Python. It aims to demonstrate various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, model evaluation, and more, as implemented with scikit-learn.

## About Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

## Features

This project may include examples demonstrating:

- **Classification:** Building models to categorize data (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests).
- **Regression:** Creating models to predict continuous values (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, SVR).
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques to reduce the number of features (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).
- **Model Selection & Evaluation:** Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV), and various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RÂ²).
- **Preprocessing:** Techniques like data scaling, normalization, and encoding categorical features.

## Installation and Setup

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python installed on your system, along with the necessary machine learning libraries.

### Prerequisites

Recommended Setup (using conda or venv)
- Python (3.7+ recommended)
- Git

### Recommended Setup (using a Virtual Environment)

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

#### Option 1: Using Anaconda/Miniconda (Recommended for Data Science)

If you don't have Anaconda or Miniconda installed, you can download it from their official websites:
- [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (a smaller version of Anaconda)

Miniconda (a smaller version of Anaconda)
Once installed, follow these steps in your terminal:

1.  **Create a new conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n scikit_env python=3.9
    ```
    *(You can choose a different Python version if needed, e.g., `python=3.8` or `python=3.10`)*

2.  **Activate the environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate scikit_env
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
    ```
    This command installs scikit-learn and common dependencies:
    - `numpy` (for numerical operations)
    - `pandas` (for data manipulation)
    - `matplotlib` (for plotting)
    - `jupyter` (for running .ipynb notebooks)

#### Option 2: Using `venv` (Python's built-in virtual environment)

1.  **Navigate to your desired project directory and create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the environment:**
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
    ```

### Cloning the Repository

Once your environment is set up and activated, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rub4ik/scikit-learn.git
cd scikit-learn
```

## Usage

After setting up your environment and cloning the repository, you can explore the examples.

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

If the project contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files), you can run them as follows:

1.  Activate your virtual environment (if not already active).
2.  Start the Jupyter Notebook server from the repository's root directory:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
This will open a new tab in your web browser, displaying the contents of the repository. You can then navigate to and open any `.ipynb` file to run the code cells.

### Running Python Scripts
.
If the project contains standalone Python scripts (`.py` files), you can run them from your terminal:

1.  Activate your virtual environment (if not already active).
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3.  Execute a script:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
    *(Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual file name.)*

## Contributing

Execute a script:
python your_script_name.py
(Replace your_script_name.py with the actual file name.)
If you'd like to contribute to this project (e.g., add more examples, improve existing ones, fix bugs), please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
3.  Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m 'Add new feature: Describe your changes'
    ```
4.  Push your changes to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
5.  Open a Pull Request to the original repository.
