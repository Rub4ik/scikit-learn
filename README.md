Scikit-learn Project
This repository serves as a personal exploration and collection of examples utilizing the powerful scikit-learn machine learning library in Python. It aims to demonstrate various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, model evaluation, and more, as implemented with scikit-learn.

About Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

Features
This project may include examples demonstrating:

Classification: Building models to categorize data (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests).

Regression: Creating models to predict continuous values (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, SVR).

Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering).

Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques to reduce the number of features (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).

Model Selection & Evaluation: Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV), metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RÂ²).

Preprocessing: Data scaling, normalization, encoding categorical features.

Installation and Setup
To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python installed on your system, along with the necessary machine learning libraries.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

Recommended Setup (using conda or venv)
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

Option 1: Using Anaconda/Miniconda (Recommended for Data Science)
If you don't have Anaconda or Miniconda installed, you can download it from their official website:

Anaconda Distribution

Miniconda (a smaller version of Anaconda)

Once installed, follow these steps:

Create a new conda environment:

conda create -n scikit_env python=3.9

(You can choose a different Python version if needed.)

Activate the environment:

conda activate scikit_env

Install the required libraries:

pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter

This command installs scikit-learn and common dependencies like numpy (for numerical operations), pandas (for data manipulation), matplotlib (for plotting), and jupyter (for running .ipynb notebooks).

Option 2: Using venv (Python's built-in virtual environment)
Create a virtual environment:
Navigate to the root directory of your cloned repository and run:

python -m venv venv

Activate the environment:

On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

Install the required libraries:

pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter

Cloning the Repository
Once your environment is set up and activated, you can clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rub4ik/scikit-learn.git
cd scikit-learn

Usage
After setting up your environment and cloning the repository, you can explore the examples.

Running Jupyter Notebooks
If the project contains Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), you can run them as follows:

Activate your virtual environment (if not already active).

Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

jupyter notebook

This will open a new tab in your web browser, displaying the contents of the repository. You can then navigate to and open any .ipynb file to run the code cells.

Running Python Scripts
If the project contains standalone Python scripts (.py files), you can run them from your terminal:

Activate your virtual environment (if not already active).

Execute a script:

python your_script_name.py

(Replace your_script_name.py with the actual file name.)

Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this project (e.g., add more examples, improve existing ones, fix bugs), please follow these steps:

Fork the repository.

Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name).

Make your changes.

Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add new feature').

Push to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature-name).

Open a Pull Request.
